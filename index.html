            <p>When I first saw you, it was like looking at the world differently. It was like seeing colours for the first time, as if we knew each other from past lives, and I immediately knew that we would have a story together. I didn't know exactly when, but I knew that we'd probably meet at some point, just by chance.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>We made our relationship official in May. I'd never experienced romantic love before. I was pretty worried about it all. I was afraid to trust and show myself vulnerable to another person, and even to imagine that someone could love me just as I am. But you showed me that I'm not too tricky to love and that it's worth waiting for the right person.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>It's hard to keep a long-distance relationship going when I miss you more than anything else, but I've fallen for your commitment to me, for encouraging me to fulfil my dream and your desire to wait for my return. We've been through a lot together and we have much more to experience. Wherever you are, as long as you've got it with you.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>There are a million reasons why I love you, and I don't even know where to start. You've inspired a love in me that I thought was impossible to feel. I'm lucky to have you with me today, tomorrow, and always.
